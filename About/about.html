        <h1>About</h1>
        <p id="desc">This page is to inform the reader about anything that has to do with the product of AARS as well with an introduction from the team and a timeline of all events that took place to complete the project</p>

        <h2>What Is AARS?</h2>
        <p>Automatic Attendance Recording System (AARS) is a system complex system that uses both hardware and software to automate the task of taking attendance as fast and as efficient as possible. AARS uses a Raspberry Pi and a RFID detector along with RFID cards to count attendance. It allows teachers and organizations to save time from manually counting attendance and allows organizations to manage workers shifts better. AARS is both a payed and a free service. We offer the hardware needed for $79.99 USD per (class)room while we offer our software for free. Our software is what separates us from our competition. This is where we give our customers the best experience they can have. Make sure to try the demo to see if AARS is right for you and your organization.</p>

        <h2>Features and Specifications</h2>
        <p>The project was designed with a school setting in mind, but it may also be used on an office setting. We know that our project might have already been widely implemented for security (such as HID systems) but we wanted to make a widescale and cheap alternative; AARS does exactly just that. Each sensor (1 unit) will cost around $70 USD compared to $200 usd average of industry grade controllers. The software on most industry grade systems is also paid separately, compared to AARS which uses free and open source software. This project relies more on the software than hardware so you know that you will not lose much if anything happens to any sensor, it can get replaced and set up with our software at no additional charge.</p>

        <h2>Meet The Team</h2>
        <p>Surabhi (Researcher):</p>
        <p id="descT">Hello, I am Surabhi, the lead researcher of the group. I focus on collecting data and information on how to do the project and what is needed for it to succeed. The research I gather is anything related to the project and will later be compiled together into a written report and presentation for our project. I make sure to research necessary things that will benefit the project altogether.</p>

        <p>Phoenix (Notetaker):</p>
         <p id="descT">Hello, I am Phoenix, I am the note taker of the group. I personally love taking notes and keeping things organized, that is why I was chosen for this role. I record notes, discussions, topics, and important information. The notes I take helps the group remember what we have talked about, will talk about, and things we need to talk about. This role is highly important so we can keep track of our discussions and ideas. I make sure notes are taken each time we have a group discussion.</p>

        <p>Kevin (Lead Programmer):</p>
        <p id="descT">Hello, I am just going to steal the same intro as Jimmy and introduce myself. My name is Kevin and I will be the lead programmer if you could not guess by the name of my job. I was picked for this job because mainly I knew a lot python and Java, plus I am good at problem solving. I as the lead programmer I will be building the DB that the project will have to be based on. I hope our team will work well.</p>

        <p>Jimmy (Team Manager & Programmer):</p>
        <p id="descT">Hello, I am Jimmy and I am the team leader and programmer. I organize and keep tabs on everyone to make the teamwork the best it can. I am the original proposer of the AARS project, so I help lead the development of the project. I am also the programmer which means that I have worked on building the website and database code. I am only one of two available programmers which is why my focus is on the database code. As the team leader, I am proud of having Surabhi, Phoenix, and Kevin on my team</p>
