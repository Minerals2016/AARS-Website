        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p id="desc">This page is to show you how to recreate our project. This project can easily recreated and because our software is open source, it means that you can have it up and running in no time! All instruction will be here for your convenience. If you get stuck along the way make sure to check out our resources (from navigation bar)</p>

        <h2>Before You Start</h2>
        <p>Before you start, it is important that you have enough time to complete the project. A timeline of fulltime dedication of one to two weeks should be enough. This project will require knowledge in both programming and electronics. It is best if you have a team, but you can also do this on your own if you please. Depending on your skill level, you can build certain parts of the AARS system. Below you will find this list of parts and skill level. Patience will be a very big factor into successfully completing this project. You are bound to have many mistakes and re-dos; this is normal. If you get stuck on something you may view our resources for reference.</p>

        <h2>Building Local Raspberry Pi RFID detector (simulated):</h2>
        <p>In order to simulate the RFID detector, we will use the capabilities of HTML and JS in order to achieve this. We will create the webpage first in order to recreate the “scan” action and to get the input for JS. We will only create a small form which will have a ‘select’ option as well as a button to scan the ID. The IDs will be placed in the select input and the button will be linked with an onclick event. Of course, we will have id options for our html tags in order to use it with JS later. Here is what the code should look like:</p>
        <img src="../Images/one.png" alt="image" id="one"> 
        <p>This is the simple view and should look something like this: </p>
        <img src="../Images/two.png" alt="image" id="two">

        <h2>Building the Dashboard UI</h2>
        <p>So, in the first step, we only did the UI for the input, so we will now build the UI for the output. In order to do that, we decided to use a table to make it teacher friendly. The table will be long depending on how many students you have in a class. To create the table please refer to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">this site</a>. We will also include id options for all html tags used in the table (in order to write input later). Your html should look something like this: </p>
        <img src="../Images/three.png" alt="image" id="three">
        <p><em>Please note: this image is just a snippet of the whole scale of the table. Class is also used to hide elements from mobile view using .hide {display: none;}</em></p>
        <p>The UI of the database should look something like this: </p>
        <img src="../Images/four.png" alt="image" id="four">
        <p>Once you are done with that, you can go to the next step (don’t forget the ids).</p>

        <h2>Hooking up dashboard to JS: </h2>
        <p>Once we have the table dashboard set up, we are now ready to hook that up to give it functionality. You will use JS so we will make a new file. After you made the new file, you will make a function that will get called when you click the button. After that, you will need to get the ids of all the tags from the table (which is why we require all ids on all tags of the table). To do that use var [any name] = document.getElementById(“[id of tag]”). Note: don’t copy the [] it’s there so you can place something in there. The declaration should look something like this:</p>
        <img src="../Images/five.png" alt="image"  id="five">
        <p>We will now be creating the timer for the timestamp. This is required as it is the bases on how the program determines whether a person is present, absent, or if they do not belong there. Time in JS is relatively simple (compared to other languages like Python) and uses the time function to get the time. We will create the function like shown below: </p>
        <img src="../Images/six.png" alt="image"  id="six">
        <p>After that time function, we will now create the conditionals for all students in the id array. For this, we need to get the value from the choices on the input simulator from html and will get it here with the .value selector. We need to check whether the person is even in the class, if it isn’t, it gets tagged red. This is what that code looks like: </p>
        <img src="../Images/seven.png" alt="image"  id="seven">
        <p>After we are done with that, we need to then get another conditional to tell the status of the person that is getting scanned as well as inputting manual data into the database. To do this, make sure to copy this code below:</p>
        <img src="../Images/eight.png" alt="image"  id="eight">
        <p id="pad">We are now done with everything and you have simulated the hardware and one portion of the database. If this was the original project, there would be 2 more databases to build. Hope this guide was useful! Please check our resources page if you are still stuck and need more help.</p>
