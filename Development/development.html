        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p id="desc">This page is to show you how to recreate our project. This project can easily recreated and because our software is open source, it means that you can have it up and running in no time! All instruction will be here for your convenience. If you get stuck along the way make sure to check out our resources (from navigation bar)</p>

        <h2>Before You Start</h2>
        <p>Before you start, it is important that you have enough time to complete the project. A timeline of fulltime dedication of one to two weeks should be enough. This project will require knowledge in both programming and electronics. It is best if you have a team, but you can also do this on your own if you please. Depending on your skill level, you can build certain parts of the AARS system. Below you will find this list of parts and skill level. Patience will be a very big factor into successfully completing this project. You are bound to have many mistakes and re-dos; this is normal. If you get stuck on something you may view our resources for reference.</p>

        <h2>Building Local Raspberry Pi RFID detector (simulated)</h2>
        <p>We were unable to do this part due to not having the hardware necessary to complete it. We realized that we could simulate this part by instead setting this on the web. Building a drag and drop for the ID for the RP will be more complex and will take longer so we will simulate this using a text-line approach.</p>

        <p>We can get a function to output the date and then make an imaginary ID on a variable. We will write all of this under one function to keep it on the same scope. This is the most basic you can get with it.</p>

        <p><em>/*More detailed instructions will come out once I get to this part*/</em></p>
