        <h1>Dashboard</h1>
        <p id="desc">This is the dashboard where you can look at the results of all of the IDs that have been scanned. This is what the dashboard would look like for the first version of AARS but more updates can be added in the future. This dashboard has more functionaility on a computer compared to a phone. A simplified version of the PC version is shown in case you do not have access to your PC.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>This dashboard is just a visual and not many interactible things can be done in it yet. This just shows you your attendance sheet. This is something similar to a gradebook except it doesn't have grades but instead attendance.</p>


        <p>The first column shows you all of the names of all of the students in the class. The second column shows you the card ID of the person from the first column. This is mainly useful for troubleshooting in case there is a user mistake (someone accidentally scans the card); this is why it is not shown on mobile. The third column just shows you the grade of the person for better orientation for the teacher (this is not shown on the mobile version). The fourth column column just shows you the status of the person from the first column. This status is the most important thing of this dashboard. This shows you whether or not someone is present of if they are late or even if they are in the wrong location. The fifth column shows the time that their card has been scanned. This helps in case there was a mistake with the software or just for reference (not showned on mobile version). The sixth and final column is for comments. This comments section can be used to input input any comments critical to attendance. This is to be better informed of studens' behaivor.</p>
